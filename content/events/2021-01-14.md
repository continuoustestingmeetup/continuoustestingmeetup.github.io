### Test process improvement in an agile environment
[Dominique Mühlbauer: Quality Advocate & Agile Evangelist at Trendig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominiquemuehlbauer/)

Agile practices are becoming more and more important in software development nowadays. Most companies are 
using them to achieve a shorter the time-to-market, improved quality or in order to mitigate risk. These 
advantages are achieved through iterative releases in short cycles, in order to get fast and reliable 
(customer) feedback. This can be realized, because of the integration of all software development tasks – 
from the gathering of the user stories, via the coding to testing and deployment – in one process and team. 
A far spread approach to achieve this is to drive the development via test, which makes testing far more 
important for the teams as in traditional environments.

But how to improve on the testing practices in an agile environment?
This talk presents a lightweight approach for continuous testing improvement, which seamlessly fits in 
agile practices. This helps teams to analyze and optimize their testing practices, while delivering value 
to their customers without interruption.

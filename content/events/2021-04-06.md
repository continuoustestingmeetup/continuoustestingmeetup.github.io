### Beginning Test Automation: Part 3 of 3
[Lindsay Walker - Technical E-Learning Developer at Sauce Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsayjowalker/)

This meetup is the final of three 90-minute virtual events intended for those interested 
in learning about test automation.

As a refresher, this 3-part series is designed to help you learn about the basics of 
what automated testing is, what your options are, why automated testing is a great career 
opportunity, and how to write some simple tests. Each workshop will consist of a 30-45 
minute presentation, followed by an assignment and workshop time with some test automation experts

#### Part 3 - Advanced Testing Features (April 6)

In this third session, users will learn about the Page Object Model and the advantages 
of abstracting test methods and test data to make maintainable test code. There will be 
a demo of abstracting test methods into a separate page class. We will also talk about 
web drivers, and how you can use WebDriverManager to facilitate this. Work as a group 
through setting up a test to run on Sauce Labs as outlined in lesson 4.05

Users will follow steps to move certain code from a single test class into page & test 
objects, as well as create a Config file to store test variables for the application 
under test (https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) and the configuration for Sauce Labs. 
Complete Module 3 and run it on Sauce Labs.

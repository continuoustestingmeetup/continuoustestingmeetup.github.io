### “Integration Testing with Cypress”
[Nancy Du - Solutions Architect at Rangle.io](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancyduyi/)

Automated UI testing is an important part of ensuring quality, which establishes 
confidence and help you ship faster. Unfortunately, writing e2e tests with protractor 
is difficult, hard to scale and will quickly become a maintenance nightmare. You can 
reduce your reliance on e2e tests by adding integration tests to your strategy. In 
this talk we will take a look at how Cypress can help you implement a strong 
integration strategy that improves efficiency, quality and promotes collaboration 
across your team.

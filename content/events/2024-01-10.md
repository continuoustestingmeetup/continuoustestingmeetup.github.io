### “API automation in C# with RestAssured .Net”

[Bas Dijkstra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/basdijkstra)

[REST Assured](https://rest-assured.io/) has been a popular API testing library in the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) ecosystem for years. Until recently, however, there has not
been a library that provides a similar DSL and ease of use in the [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET) ecosystem.
Combine that with me looking for a project to help me sharpen my developer skills, and you get why RestAssured.Net was created.
In this talk / live coding demo, you'll see how to get started with RestAssured.Net for writing tests for your HTTP-based APIs, as well as
some of its most useful features.
I'll also tell you a bit about my experiences in writing, publishing, and maintaining an open-source library, and you'll get a glimpse of what's
coming up next for RestAssured.Net.

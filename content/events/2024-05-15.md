[AI model](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-model) robustness testing is crucial to ensure that machine learning models perform reliably across various scenarios and datasets. It helps identify potential vulnerabilities, biases, or inaccuracies in the model's predictions, improving its overall reliability and trustworthiness. Generalization testing ensures that AI models can effectively generalize to new, unseen data beyond the training set, enhancing their real-world applicability. In this session we will go through different aspects associated with the AI Model Robustness and Generalization Testing

### Automated Testing of Electron Apps using WebdriverIO

ElectronJS has risen to prominence as a preferred framework for creating native desktop applications that are pivotal to business operations. Applications such as Slack, Figma, and Microsoft Teams have become integral components of our professional productivity suite. Consequently, when these applications experience downtime or exhibit glitches, the repercussions on our productivity are significant.

Testing ElectronJS applications presents a unique set of challenges for developers and QA teams. With Electron's ability to create cross-platform desktop apps, ensuring consistent functionality across different operating systems becomes crucial. Additionally, Electron-specific elements and interactions further complicate the testing process. Moreover, many struggle with the initial setup and integration of testing tools like WebdriverIO into their ElectronJS development workflow.

In this talk, _**Christian Bromann**_ - Software Developer at Ionic, aims to demystify testing ElectronJS applications using WebdriverIO. He will provide attendees with a solid foundation in both ElectronJS application development and WebdriverIO testing. He'll explore ElectronJS fundamentals, including main and renderer processes, platform compatibility, and Electron-specific features. Simultaneously, he'll delve into WebdriverIO basics, covering setup and writing effective test scripts specific for ElectronJS applications.

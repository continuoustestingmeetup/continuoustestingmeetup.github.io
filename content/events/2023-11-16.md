### “Fast Testing Using Cypress For Free”

[Gleb Bahmutov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bahmutov)

In this presentation, Gleb will explain how to speed up [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) test execution locally and on [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
using free open-source solutions that do not require paying for 3rd party dashboards or services.
We will explore using API calls, data caching, and app actions to speed up each test.
We also will see how to configure CI specs to split the entire test suite into multiple machines running in parallel.
This presentation will benefit anyone who wants their end-to-end and component Cypress tests to finish quickly.

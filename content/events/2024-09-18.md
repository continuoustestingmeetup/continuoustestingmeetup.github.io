### “New Challenges in Software Quality Brought by GenAI and LLMs”

[Federico Toledo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicotoledo/)

In this talk, we will delve into the emerging challenges that generative [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) ([GenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence)) and [Large Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) (LLMs) bring to the world of software quality and testing. We will explore how the integration, use, or design of solutions with GenAI models pose new challenges, including data quality and bias detection, dealing with non-determinism in our [test automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation) and privacy and security concerns. We will review some proposals that are being implemented to adjust our testing tasks to the development of such systems, including approaches to automated testing and observability.

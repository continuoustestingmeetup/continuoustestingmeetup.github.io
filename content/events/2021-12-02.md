### “The Screenplay Pattern: Better Interactions for Better Automation”
[Andrew Knight - The Automation Panda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-leland-knight/)


Automating interactions for tests is hard. For the past decade, the primary way to automate 
web UI interactions has been the Page Object Model. Unfortunately, page objects do not scale 
well because, by design, they allow lots of code duplication and unsafe activity. 
The Screenplay Pattern is a much better pattern for handling interactions. In Screenplay, 
Actors use Abilities to perform Interactions.

In this talk, I'll back up that claim in three parts:

1. I’ll cover problems with traditional ways of automating interactions.
2. I’ll explain why the Screenplay Pattern is a better way.
3. I’ll show how to use the Screenplay Pattern with a C# library named Boa Constrictor.

We will implement both a Web UI search engine test and a REST API web service test in C# 
with Boa Constrictor to demonstrate how to write readable, reliable tests using Screenplay 
calls. By the end of this talk, you'll be able to start using the Screenplay Pattern for 
your own tests!

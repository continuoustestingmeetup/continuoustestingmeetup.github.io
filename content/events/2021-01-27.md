### Selenium + JUnit 5: The Perfect Match
[Boni García: Assistant Professor at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonigg/)

Selenium has become the de-facto standard framework for end-to-end web testing nowadays. JUnit 5 is the 
latest version of this popular testing framework and implements a brand-new programming and extension model 
named Jupiter.

This talk presents [Selenium-Jupiter](https://bonigarcia.github.io/selenium-jupiter/), an open-source JUnit 5 
extension aimed to provide seamless integration with Selenium.

At first glance, it allows creating Selenium tests using local or remote browsers, reducing the required 
boilerplate thanks to the dependency injection mechanism supported in JUnit 5. Moreover, it will enable us 
to use different types of web browsers and Android devices in Docker containers out of the box.

All in all, Selenium-Jupiter can be used to carry out different types of tests for web and mobile applications, 
including functional, compatibility (using test templates to define different devices or browsers -types and versions-) 
or performance tests.

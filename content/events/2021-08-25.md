### “Automation in Testing - Simplify Your Daily Testing Business”
[Kay Grebenstein - Software Tester and Agile QA Coach at ZEISS Digital Innovation](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kay-grebenstein-78088b91/)

Automation in Testing (AiT) is not test automation. It is an approach by Richard 
Bradshaw and Mark Winteringham to promote human-centered automation in testing. 
The idea is to automate recurring manual tasks with AiT and have more time for 
the essentials like time for testing and looking for defects.

In the talk I explain the approach plus dos and don’ts. Also I present good practice 
and examples from our projects like optimization of bug reports with animated GIFs, 
the automatic integration of automated test results in test management tools, 
the automatic creation of flexible test reports and much more.

### Assuring or Not Assuring quality?
[Ioana Porcarasu: Head of Quality Engineering at Wealth Wizards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ioanafinaru/)

Continuous testing, continuous delivery, DevOps – these are all terms very popular in the last couple of years, and they all involve a shift in the way we deliver products, testing included! So who is responsible for the quality assurance nowadays?
In this talk I'll go through some steps we took and processes we implemented to create a higher collaborative space where everyone takes ownership of changes all the way through production rather than handing them over.
Of course, we'll also focus on the questions everyone is thinking about: "Do you still have testers? And what do they do now?"

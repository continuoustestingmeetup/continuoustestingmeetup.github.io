In this talk, we'll explore using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), an [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) natural language processing model, to improve web app testing and continuous integration. While [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) can generate human-like text, we'll discuss its limitations for complex software engineering tasks.

We'll show how [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) can help build a web app by generating test cases that cover different scenarios and edge cases. Using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to automate test execution can streamline the testing process, making it easier to continuously integrate new changes.

Using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) in testing and continuous integration has the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness. We'll provide examples to illustrate its capabilities.

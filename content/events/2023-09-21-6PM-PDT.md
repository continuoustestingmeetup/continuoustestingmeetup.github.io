### “ChatGPT takes on web development: from concept to launch”

For many companies, testing is perceived as the primary limitation for being able to release software more frequently. Somehow, someone decides on a process or a set of requirements that designates a particular collection of code as ready for users. Evaluating everything manually is obviously too slow, but even when companies automate the testing process, things just shift to a different set of challenges that restrict velocity.

In this talk, join Marcus Merrell and Titus Fortner as they discuss how to better realize the promises of test automation on overall delivery throughput.

They will focus on three separate components:

- Scaling test automation to get required information faster
- Improving the information to get required confidence faster
- Accounting for risk tolerance to know what confidence is required

### “Growing A Culture of Quality”
[Simon Prior - Head of the Digital Test teams at EasyJet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-prior-0499372/)

Long ago was a time where testing was purely seen as an activity by a siloed team who executed 
1000’s of tests towards the end of a project. In the modern world, this is still a very real 
situation in some areas, but on the whole, testing as a collaborative, continuous activity is 
much more the norm.

But getting to that stage is not easy, for some reason, there has historically been a stigma 
attached to testing as a lesser activity that slows the release of a project down and changing 
this mindset is a huge obstacle to get over.

In places where testing is perceived in a negative light, it is possible to move forward, but 
it will take hard work and use of the power of persuasion, while coaching and building collaborative 
best practices which a whole range of tech teams can buy into.

In this talk, I will walk through ways to get Testing at the table for discussions and build a 
culture of Quality where the business accepts the value that testing brings and helps fight our 
corner when needed. This ultimately comes down to communication in the right ways and showing 
the value that Testing can bring to a situation.

### ‚ÄúDogfooding AI generated end-to-end tests‚Äù

[Daniel Draper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-draper92)

Join me for a talk on how we used an [LLM-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) agent to end-to-end test our own web application. I'll kick off with the baseline assumptions we had when we started to build our product - how far we thought we would be able to get with the state-of-the-art LLMs and how we structured our early prototyping.

In the second half of the talk, I‚Äôll show what we‚Äôve learned from our own experiments and over six months of applying the AI agent to testing our apps. I'll present examples of some of the challenges for the AI agent and how we are tackling them. I‚Äôll focus on real situations where the AI agent was effective and where it fell short. I‚Äôll present our own [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food#:~:text=Eating%20your%20own%20dog%20food%20or%20%22dogfooding%22%20is%20the%20practice,usage%20using%20product%20management%20techniques) strategy and how we try to ensure we ship working code, as well as one example where we still failed.

Finally, I‚Äôd like to give a little outlook on the future of AI-based software testing from our experience and discuss it with you.

#### Bio

Daniel Draper is an experienced senior full-stack engineer with a soft spot for [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)/[deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) and figuring out how to put it into useful products. He‚Äôs especially passionate about clean code and believes in building software that is not only working but also well-crafted, well-tested, readable and maintainable. His relationship with software testing is best described by his blog here. When he‚Äôs not building software he‚Äôs often out hiking + traveling with his wife or playing the drums ü•Å in different orchestras in Karlsruhe, Germany.

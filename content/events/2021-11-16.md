### “How to Bring Accessibility into Your Teams”
[Laveena Ramchandani - Senior Consultant at Deloitte UK | Blogger | Speaker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laveena-ramchandani-949b8192/)

How often have you heard that ‘Yes this is important, but we don’t have the capacity right now’ or ‘ sure let’s put it in the backlog’ ?
This is something we should not brush off or take lightly. Accessibility testing is vital especially when your product is a user facing application.
We need to be socially aware as a team and build quality towards our product with making it more accessible.

At least 1 in 5 people in the UK have a long term illness, impairment or disability. Many more have a temporary disability. 
A recent study found that 4 in 10 local council homepages failed basic tests for accessibility.

This is quite vital and the sooner we as testers can advocate this into our teams, we make our product more accessible, reduce 
the risk of bad product reviews, reputation and also be more socially aware. Let's shift left and make accessibility testing built-in our teams.

Takeaways
1. Understand why accessibility testing is important?
2. How I adapted accessibility mindset?
3. How to coach team and bring accessibility into your teams?
4. Demonstrate various tools available to perform accessibility testing

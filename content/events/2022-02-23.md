### “The Road to QA”

[Benjamin Bischoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-bischoff)

In my career as a software developer I have seen a lot of QA talents transition towards test automation - some of them even turning into developers. My journey was the other way around - from a developer into test automation.

In this talk I want to show why this was a natural choice for me, what I learned along the way and why this changed my perception of developers and QA alike.

The key takeaways are:

- how being a Test Automation Engineer combines the developer and QA roles
- how to not lose sight of coding
- how questioning one's career path can be a huge benefit

#### Bio

After being a game/application developer and trainer for 15 years, Benjamin decided in 2017 to make test automation his main career.

Currently, he works as a Test Automation Engineer (SDET) in trivago's core QA team. His focus lies on the development and maintenance of trivago’s in-house end-to-end test framework and related build pipelines as well as back-end and API automation. Additionally, he provides help with all test automation matters.

Benjamin is the author and maintainer of two open source projects for Cucumber BDD parallel test execution and reporting. Also, he is an occasional conference speaker and writes about testing and automation topics on his blog <https://www.softwaretester.blog>.

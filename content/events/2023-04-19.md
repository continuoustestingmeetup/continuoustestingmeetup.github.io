### Do customers define quality?

[Ilya Volkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivolkov)

My talk is dedicated to the frequently overlooked aspect of client interactions, and how the clients do affect the quality of the product that the software teams build. I talk about some personal and historical examples of end users having experiences with the services and how we, as software developers, can affect lives. I will discuss the role of customer-facing teams and the importance of tight collaboration between them and the engineering/development. I will also talk about relationships between customer feedback and the vectors of product development, and how these relationships can greatly differ between different companies.

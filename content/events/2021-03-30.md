### Beginning Test Automation: Part 2 of 3
[Lindsay Walker - Technical E-Learning Developer at Sauce Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsayjowalker/)

This meetup is the second of three 90-minute virtual events intended for those interested 
in learning about test automation.

As a refresher, this 3-part series is designed to help you learn about the basics of what 
automated testing is, what your options are, why automated testing is a great career 
opportunity, and how to write some simple tests. Each workshop will consist of a 30-45 
minute presentation, followed by an assignment and workshop time with some test automation experts.

Space is limited to be sure to RSVP for all three meetups in order to get the maximum 
benefit out of the series. If you missed Part 1, be sure to work through Module 1 of Sauce 
Selenium Java Course: https://training.saucelabs.com/codelabs/Module1-SeleniumJava/index.html?index=..%2F..SeleniumJava#0

#### Part 2 - Creating a Test Suite (March 30)

Learn about why you want to be able to make your tests fail. Understand locator 
strategies & experiment with locators against the-internet Heroku app. Learn about the 
Selenium 4 Capabilities, what browser capabilities and vendor capabilities are, and how 
they are used in our test code. Explore JUnit test annotations, as well as how assertions 
and locators are key parts of creating your test code.

The second half of this workshop will involve getting users to clone a repository with basic 
Java & JUnit Selenium test code onto their machines. You will work against a template to create 
a test against a chosen page on the-internet Heroku app, choosing your own locators and creating 
a very basic test using locators and an assertion. For the final challenge, do the exercise in 
Module 2.08 and submit proof in the form of a repo or screenshot.

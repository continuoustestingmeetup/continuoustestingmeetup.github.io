### The female champions of Rwanda's rising tech-scene
[Lena Simon, Founder & CEO of betahills](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lena-simon-261492184/) & [Isabelle Bucyeyeneza, QA tester at Muraho&betahills](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bucyeyeneza-isabelle-ctfl-ctfl-pt-261409193/)

Two new innovation hubs per year, most recently one funded by Klarna founder Niklas 
Adalberth, favorite African launchpad for global actors such as the Volkswagen 
Smart Mobility project and Silicon Valley based drone startup Zipline, 2nd place in 
Africa in the ease of doing business according to the World Bank. This is Rwanda in 
2020. A tech hotspot on the rise.

At the same time, Rwanda is known for its focus on gender equality. It was the first 
country in the world to have a majority of female members of parliament, currently at 
61% and one of the first countries in the world to have more female cabinet members 
than male ones. This leap for gender equity has also taken hold of the tech scene, 
with several leaders in the IT industry being female, from the Minister for ICT and 
Innovation to the heads of Irembo and DMM.HeHe, two of the three largest tech companies 
in the country.

At the core of these efforts lie systematic capacity building efforts and the conscious 
development of female leadership in the IT industry. A lighthouse project in this regard 
was a 2018 training-initiative called WeCode that most notably resulted in Rwanda's first 
all-female tech-company. This company is Betahills/Muraho a QA software-testing house 
serving startups and corporations all over Europe and North America.

This talk will introduce you to Rwanda's rising tech-scene and share the journey of 
Betahills/Muraho to becoming Rwanda's leading QA company.

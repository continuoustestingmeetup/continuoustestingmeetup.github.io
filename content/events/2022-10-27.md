### “How to Log a Bug”

[Kristin Jackvony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinjackvony)

Did you know that how well you log a bug can influence how fast it gets fixed, or even if it gets fixed at all?  No one likes it when a bug that they log gets closed by the developer with a “Cannot repro” note on it.  In this talk, Kristin will talk about the five components that are essential to a well-logged bug, and the two optional components that can make fixing the bug easy.  She’ll walk through a sample bug and show good and bad examples of logged bug details.

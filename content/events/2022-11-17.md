### “Test in the Cloud for Free - Run Docker Selenium in Heroku and Google Cloud Run”

[James Mortensen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-mortensen-b07a195)

There are plenty of paid tools out there to help scale UI automation tests, but if you're in the initial stages of writing those tests, what you really need is just a simple way of visualizing and debugging what's happening in the browser.  You can view tests in the browser with paid tools, but a fully fledged paid solution isn't necessarily what you need if you're on a budget, an independent developer, or simply early enough in the process to where you aren't ready to invest in such tools.  

I initially started writing test cases by running tests locally.  But this sometimes means dealing with a local browser popping up in front of us or stealing the focus away from something else we're trying to do while those tests are running.  I wanted a way to be able to run tests locally and also see them running in the browser, without taking up resources on my computer, and without any costs.  Solutions like Docker/Podman help with this, but when running on macOS or Windows, this involves virtualizing Linux so that containers can run on the machine.  If you're on a low-end machine, then this can significantly slow down the computer.  

In this talk, I'll take you through my journey of figuring out how to get Docker Selenium container images running on cloud container platforms such as Google Cloud Run and Heroku, using some commonly used open source tools.

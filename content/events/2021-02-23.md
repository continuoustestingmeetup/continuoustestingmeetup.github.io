### Speeding up your test execution in a fast-paced world
[Yi Min Yang: Solutions Engineer at Sauce Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi-min-yang/)

Writing and running test scripts is at the same time easy and hard. It is also easy to get it 
wrong and hard to get it right without some experience and knowledge. Small things matter.

To get started with writing test automation for your web application and/or mobile application 
is rather easy. It can be done locally with tools publicly available and free of charge. Making 
mistakes, having slow test scripts, or flaky tests is acceptable in this early stages and when 
working privately. Doing it right is the hard thing.

Everything changes though when we do this in a corporate environment. Budget is tight, time is 
limited and the next shitstorm because of lacking quality or bad UX is only a tweet away. In 
this kind of environment slow running and unreliable tests are not helpful. Small things can 
over time creep into your test suite and cause longer test execution. Longer execution time 
means higher cost, taking longer to get a result and as a consequence it takes longer to make 
a business decision. Furthermore this is exasperated if the tests are unreliable. The confidence 
in your product dwindles.

Making small adjustments and use of best practices in your test scripts can have a significant 
impact in making your tests more performant, reliable and bring you true value. Testing for the 
sake of testing is not valuable if it does not drive business decisions.

This talk is going to explore and show the impact of unoptimised tests and how to solve them.

### “Autonomous testing: Empower your testing strategies”

[Marcel Veselka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelveselka)

There are still far too many manual activities in test automation. The testing industry was advanced by introducing test automation 20+ years ago. Now it is time to move on: autonomous testing is the next phase in the evolution. In my talk, I will show where we are currently going with it. Finally, I will also show you our first results from the implementation of our autonomous visual regression testing.

#### Bio

Marcel has spent his career in software testing and currently he is working as a Principal SW Testing Consultant at Tesena. Previously, he worked as a Test Analyst and finally moved to Test Management in complex transformation projects and core banking implementations covering mainly integration testing and performance testing. He is also co-founder of the testing community called [pro]Test!. In 2013 he found the company Tesena. His special interest is modern testing approaches (including all the trendy topics like test automation, DevOps, testing in SCRUM, AI, ML, and autonomous testing).

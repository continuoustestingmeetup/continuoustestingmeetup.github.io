###  PyTest: The Awesome Parts
[Josh Grant, Solution Architect at Sauce Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-grant-9570a214/)

PyTest is an excellent test tool and library for use with Python. 
I want to talk about the awesome parts of it. In this talk, I'll 
discuss some of these awesome parts including

- How to write and run some basic tests using Pytest - without any messy overhead
- What are fixtures and how to use them
- The Pytest-selenium plugin and what it provides to help with browser-based testing.

### “Quality and speed. How Quality Assistance model helped us scale”

[Nataliia Burmei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliiaburmei)

Under the [Quality Assistance](https://www.atlassian.com/inside-atlassian/software-QA-skills) Model, you’re always on the lookout for the next challenge. As a tester and engineer, I have a lot of freedom, support, and bandwidth to experiment that I try to use wisely… You must be vigilant and aware of all of your team’s workstreams, and you should spot opportunities to improve and experiment, closing gaps whenever you see them. And finally you learn continuously so that you can adapt when needed.

#### Bio

I am Nataliia, a Test Engineer who loves travelling, books, learning new languages and sometimes writes on the side. I also love to discover how things work and why they work the way they do. I am a curious person. I have been in the testing world for a very long time. I am a self taught engineer who never stops learning. I have worked on many projects and with different people, I truly love building things from scratch, but also keen for a good refactor challenge. I always loved working with the backend part of applications, I like to be at the core of the application. Testing and work is only one part of my life. Another big part of it is my family, travelling, friends, books and theatre. I love spending my energy while running outdoors and a good cup of morning coffee makes me very happy.

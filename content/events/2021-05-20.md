### “How a translator became a tester”
[Antonella Scaravilli - Software QA Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonella-scaravilli-4489a7b9/)

I’d like to share with you my journey from being a translator to becoming a tester, 
which difficulties I've had along the way and which skills acquired during my academic 
training as a translator I still use in my testing role.

###### Bio
My name is Antonella Scaravilli and I’m from Salta, Argentina. I’ve been living in 
Barcelona for 5 years. I test iOS apps for a company that sells a SaaS to publishing 
companies and other clients. We also have our own magazine kiosk.

I love languages and learning about different topics. I’m always starting a new hobby 
or working on something new.

### “(-(-_(-_-)_-)-) all for one”
[Paloma Oliveira - Software Engineer at Sauce Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/discombobulateme/)

Open Source is not just one thing. It started as an ideology about the freedom to modify 
and distribute software in the 1990s, but it has become a powerful movement that has 
transformed the way we organize, structure ourselves, and create billion-dollar 
businesses. And this is what I aim to bring to you: a broader understanding about 
“the good, the bad and the ugly” of this “thing”.

###### Bio
A wholehearted, undisciplined explorer, moved by open source ethics, she converts questions 
about autonomy, sustainability, and ableism into curatorial investigations, artworks and codes. 
Proudly part of Sauce Labs OSPO Team & Co-founder of Zentrum für Netzkunst Berlin.

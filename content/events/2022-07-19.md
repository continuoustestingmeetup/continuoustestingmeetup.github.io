### “Shifting Quality To App-first @ La Redoute”

[Antoine Craske](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acraske)

La Redoute is a company with 180 years of history. It is mainly known for its traditional catalog that were part of many families' living rooms. But in 2014, it was close to bankruptcy, initiating an ambitious transformation plan to survive.

In 2018, La Redoute reborn from ashes back to profitability, with new business models, and offering a pure player user experience on the web. That transformation was powered by daily deliveries of the digital platform supported by more than 6500 automated tests.

But then, the rapid shift of the ecosystem to smartphones and mobile applications pushed the organization to pivot to an app-first strategy. That move challenged the existing foundations, raising questions on where to start, how to accelerate, and what to reuse?

This talk presents the experience of pivoting and maintaining a continuous testing strategy from web to an app-first model, sharing our learnings and actionable takeaways.

### “Going From Zero to 2,000 Automated Tests At A Startup”

[Dennis Martinez](https://linkedin.com/in/dennmart)

Startups have to move fast if they want to survive, but that speed often comes at the expense of quality. As someone who's worked at startups for over 20 years, I frequently see less time spent on testing on these teams. But what about not having any automated testing processes while struggling to launch? In this talk, I'll share how I helped a startup quickly establish a solid testing foundation for their soon-to-be-launched product to get them to deliver a high-quality application and the journey we went through to get from zero automated test cases to over 2,000 in a few months without sacrificing speed or quality.

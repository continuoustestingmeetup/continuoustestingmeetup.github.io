### Enhance Mobile User Experience through Performance Testing
[Sofia Palamarchuk, Director & Board member Abstracta, co-founder & CEO Apptim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiapalamarchuk/)

Consumers now expect digital experiences to exceed face-to-face experiences. Recent studies show that 80% of people have deleted a mobile app if they faced problems with its performance. This abandonment rate impacts the digital transformations that many companies are going through.

In this talk, you will learn how mobile performance impacts user experience, what you need to look for when evaluating the performance of an app, and how to start testing mobile performance earlier in the dev cycle.

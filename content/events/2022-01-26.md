### “Building & Testing a Web Application”

[Nikolay Advolodkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolayadvolodkin)

We spend a lot of time talking about testing. Or a lot of time talking about development. But what about the two together? Hello... shouldn't we be testing the code that we write?
Let's build and test a React web application together!

In this tutorial we will build a small React application. We will talk about test strategy. Then we will implement some functional Cypress tests. And also, we will add some visual tests to ensure that our app looks perfect across different platforms.

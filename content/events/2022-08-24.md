### “Clash of the Titans: Cypress vs Playwright”

[Aleksandar Zeljković](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-zeljkovic)

In this session, I am going to dive into the capabilities of the two popular e2e testing frameworks: Cypress and Playwright. The comparison will cover technical specifications, documentation, setup, features, CI/CD integration, etc. The goal is to uncover the main differences and pros/cons of each framework and potentially help anyone who wants to make a decision between these e2e test automation frameworks.

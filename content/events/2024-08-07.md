### “QA for processes: starting with hiring”

[Vitaly Sharovatov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsharovatov)

We are used to rigorous testing of code but often neglect our processes. [Quality Assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance) extends well beyond just testing code—it’s about ensuring every aspect of our work meets high standards. Processes have their own inputs, outputs, and quality attributes.

Using the hiring process as an example, we’ll explore how testing processes can enhance consistency, reliability, and overall quality.

### “Shifting Accessibility Testing to the Left”
[Marie Drake - Quality Engineering Manager at Zoopla](https://www.mariedrake.com/)

For most companies, accessibility testing is still seen as an afterthought and there 
is often a misconception that testing for accessibility is difficult and time-consuming. 
We know that there's a lot of benefits in making your website or application accessible, 
especially in the Digital Era, but why do we still have a lot of inaccessible websites? 

In this talk, Marie Drake will discuss some of the myths around accessibility testing, 
how you can shift accessibility testing to the left and how you can easily integrate 
it into your development and testing workflows.

### “API Exploratory Testing with Postman”

[Gil Zilberfeld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilzilberfeld)

**Postman is an API invocation tool**

When we're thinking about APIs testing, we'll use it for operating and checking that the APIs work correctly. But not today. Today, I'll show you how to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to do exploration testing of APIs.
What is [exploratory testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing) anyway? How is it different than "regular testing"? And how does that apply to APIs? And is  Postman up to the task? I'll explain the theory behind exploratory tests, and how because APIs are so complex, they are a prime candidate for that. We need to explore how they behave before releasing them into the wild. And don't forget some Postman tips for that "regular testing" bits. Postman is a powerful tool, and it makes sense to know it a bit better.

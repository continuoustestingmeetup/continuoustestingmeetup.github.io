### Continuous Feedback with Github Actions
[Aaron Evans, Test Automation & Continuous Delivery Consultant at One Shore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronevans/)

The easier it is to access data, the more valuable it becomes. Running test automation as part of a CI process 
is great, but to see the results, you either need to go to the CI tool or have reports sent to them (via email 
or slack, for instance). Your repository is the source of truth for code, it can also be for tests.

I'll demonstrate how you can use GitHub actions to kick off tests to run in a cloud environment on every pull 
request and publish the results to the repository, without using a CI server.

###### Bio
I'm a software tester, developer, and technology entrepreneur. My specialty is building test automation 
with open source tools and cloud services. One Shore is my software development & QA consulting company. 
If you have a project I might be interested, please let me know.

I work remotely and travel around the world with my family. My latest adventure is building a yurt in 
the Montana wilderness.

### Beginning Test Automation: Part 1 of 3
[Lindsay Walker - Technical E-Learning Developer at Sauce Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsayjowalker/)

Hello Continuous Testing Meetup community! We hope this post finds you all healthy & safe. 
We thought a series of three 90-minute virtual events intended would be great for those 
interested in learning about test automation - March 23, March 30 and April 6.

In this 3-part series, you will learn about the basics of what automated testing is, what 
your options are, why automated testing is a great career opportunity, and how to write 
some simple tests. Each workshop will consist of a 30-45 minute presentation, followed 
by an assignment and workshop time with some test automation experts.

Space is limited to be sure to RSVP for all three meetups in order to get the maximum 
benefit out of the series.

#### Part 1 - What is Automated Testing? (March 23)

Learn about what pieces go into creating an automated test. Understand what the Selenium 
and Appium projects are, and how you blend this with a coding language and testing 
library to create test code. Learn about other types of testing frameworks & how they 
are different. Next, we will go over the elements in a simple test file, and understand 
the pom.xml file in a Maven project.

For the second half, attendees will be introduced to guides for setting up Java, Maven, 
environment variables including a Sauce Labs username and access key, and IntelliJ on 
your computer and cloning or downloading test code to try out running a simple test.

You will need to create a free Sauce Labs account (if you don't already have one), 
you can do that here:

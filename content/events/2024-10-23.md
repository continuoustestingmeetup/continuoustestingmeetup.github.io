### “Faster, Stronger, Better: Can we make performance testing continuous?”

[Matthieu Leroux-Huet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lrxmatt/)

This talk bridges the gap between theoretical performance testing concepts and hard-earned lessons from real-world implementation. We dive into actionable techniques that will help you deploy and maintain a fruitful [Continuous Performance Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing) practice. We address a wide spectrum of common mistakes and misunderstandings: the crucial differences between [Performance Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing) and [Load Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_testing), environment must-haves, pitfalls in metrics management, result analysis challenges, and much more.
By the end of this presentation, you'll be better equipped to implement a truly continuous approach, enabling your team to deliver faster, stronger, and better applications that meet modern performance expectations.

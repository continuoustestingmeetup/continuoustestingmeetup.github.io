Thank you for considering to submit a talk! We are looking forward to read 
your proposal 😊

We welcome any topic that can contribute to that goal.

#### But I've never done a presentation 😰

Don't worry about that! We are here to help 😊 We encourage new speakers and
if you need any help to shape up your topic, do a dry run with you, and much
more! Remember that you can start with a short lighning talk ⚡️ Everyone is
welcome! Just mention your preferences in the submit form.

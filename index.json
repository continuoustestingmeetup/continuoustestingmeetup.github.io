If you don’t want to be surprised after releasing your application to the market, you have to take care that the application works in your target audience\u0026rsquo;s most used browsers. Therefore, not only function tests are required, but also interoperability tests must be considered in your test strategy.\nINTEROPERABILITY TESTING is a software testing type, that checks whether the software can interact with other software components and systems without any compatibility issues. In your case, you must consider Cross-browser compatibility testing.\nCross-browser compatibility testing has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years and there is a reason for it. While technology is evolving rapidly, people aren’t. A significant amount of people are resistant to changes, or more specifically, “have an aversion to upgrading their tech”. In this scenario, it’s browser compatibility testing that enables companies to ensure that no customer is left behind or has an experience that is not desired. So even though browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox dominate the market, there are people using their older versions, or other browsers. And their numbers are too high to be ignored. This phänomän is called browser fragmentation.\nIt is important to choose the right combination of web browsers and operating systems for testing. There is usually a trade-off between test cost and range. Therefore, this entire exercise is finding the right balance - testing with minimal browsers/devices to ensure that the maximum number of people can use the application.\nBy virtualizing test resources using browser clouds, the problem of ever-increasing browser fragmentation (browser type, platform, OS version) and the question of interoperability can be effectively and efficiently solved.\nThis talk uses a practical example to show what needs to be considered when designing the test strategy from an organizational perspective (non-functional requirements, browser policy, browser test strategy, browser test coverage, \u0026hellip;) and how the cross-browser tests were integrated into the continuous delivery pipelines by using browser device clouds.\nBio Matthias Zax works as an agile engineering coach at Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI).

It is also easy to get it wrong and hard to get it right without some experience and knowledge. Small things matter.\nTo get started with writing test automation for your web application and/or mobile application is rather easy. It can be done locally with tools publicly available and free of charge. Making mistakes, having slow test scripts, or flaky tests is acceptable in this early stages and when working privately. Doing it right is the hard thing.\nEverything changes though when we do this in a corporate environment. Budget is tight, time is limited and the next shitstorm because of lacking quality or bad UX is only a tweet away. In this kind of environment slow running and unreliable tests are not helpful. Small things can over time creep into your test suite and cause longer test execution. Longer execution time means higher cost, taking longer to get a result and as a consequence it takes longer to make a business decision. Furthermore this is exasperated if the tests are unreliable. The confidence in your product dwindles.\nMaking small adjustments and use of best practices in your test scripts can have a significant impact in making your tests more performant, reliable and bring you true value. Testing for the sake of testing is not valuable if it does not drive business decisions.\nThis talk is going to explore and show the impact of unoptimised tests and how to solve them.\nBio Yi Min is an EMEA-based Solution Engineer working for Sauce Labs.

However, the speed of development is expected to increase every release.\nHow can you make sure that your application is safe to be delivered without compromising quality in the process? This is what I started wondering a few years back. I encounter a long list of test cases created and I was the final responsible for signing off before release. So, I started to experiment with different methods of improving the test execution and deciding what tests to run. In this talk, I will be sharing this experience.\nFrom simple actions such as making sure you clean your tests and having a shorter list of ‘must runs’, all the way to using artificial intelligence to pick the tests that are more likely to fail, you will gain knowledge that will help YOU improve your current testing speed.\nBio Noemi is a computer scientist passionate about technology and testing.
